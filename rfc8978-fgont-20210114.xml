       <t>In scenarios where network configuration information
related to IPv6 prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit and reliable
signaling of that condition (such as when a Customer Edge router crashes and
reboots without knowledge of the previously employed prefixes), hosts on the
local network may continue using stale prefixes for an unacceptably long time
(on the order of several days), thus resulting in connectivity problems. This
document describes this issue and discusses operational workarounds that may
help to improve network robustness. Additionally, it highlights areas where
further work may be needed.</t>

       <name>Introduction</name>
       <t>IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref
target="RFC4862" format="default"/> conveys information about prefixes to be
employed for address configuration via Prefix Information Options (PIOs) sent
in Router Advertisement (RA) messages. IPv6 largely assumes prefix stability,
with network renumbering only taking place in a planned manner, old/stale
prefixes being phased out via reduced prefix lifetimes, and new prefixes (with
longer lifetimes) being introduced at the same time. However, there are several
scenarios that may lead to the so-called "flash-renumbering" events, where a
prefix employed by a network suddenly becomes invalid and replaced by a new
prefix. In some of these scenarios, the local router producing the network
renumbering event may try to deprecate the currently employed prefix (by
explicitly signaling the network about the renumbering event), whereas in other
scenarios, it may be unable to do so.</t>

s/the currently employed prefix/the stale prefixes/ would add clarity, and help avoid the mix of singular/plural.

       <t>In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit and reliable signaling of that
condition, hosts on the local network may continue using stale prefixes for an
unacceptably long period of time, thus resulting in connectivity problems.</t> 
       <t>Scenarios where this problem may arise include, but are not limited to, the following:</t>
       <ul spacing="normal">
	 <li>The most common IPv6 deployment scenario for residential or small
office networks, where a Customer Edge (CE) router employs DHCPv6 Prefix
Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/> to request a
prefix from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), and a sub-prefix of the leased
prefix is advertised on the LAN side of the CE router via Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/>. In
scenarios where the CE router crashes and reboots, the CE router may obtain (via
DHCPv6-PD) a different prefix from the one previously leased, and therefore
advertise (via SLAAC) a new sub-prefix on the LAN side. Hosts will typically
configure addresses for the new prefix but will also normally retain and may
actively employ the addresses configured for the previously advertised prefix,
since their associated Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime allow them to do
so.</li> 
	 <li>A router (e.g., Customer Edge router) advertises autoconfiguration
 prefixes (corresponding to prefixes learned via DHCPv6-PD) with constant PIO
 lifetimes that are not synchronized with the DHCPv6-PD lease time (even though
 <xref target="RFC8415" sectionFormat="of" section="6.3"/> requires such
 synchronization). While this behavior violates the aforementioned requirement
 from <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/>, it is not an unusual behavior,
 particularly for implementations in which, e.g., DHCPv6-PD is implemented in a different software module
 than the SLAAC router component.</li>
 

	 <li>A switch port a host is connected to is moved to another subnet
       (VLAN) as a result of manual switch-port reconfiguration or 802.1x
       reauthentication.  There has been evidence that
       some 802.1x supplicants do not reset network settings after
       successful 802.1x authentication.  So if a host fails 802.1x
       authentication for some reason, is placed in a "quarantine" VLAN,
       and is successfully authenticated later on, it might end up
       having IPv6 addresses from both the old ("quarantine") and the new VLANs.</li>
	 <li>During a planned network renumbering event, a router is configured to
       send an RA including a Prefix Information
 Option (PIO) for the "old" prefix with Preferred Lifetime set to zero and the Valid Lifetime set to a small value, and a PIO for the new prefix with default lifetimes.
 However, due to unsolicited RAs being sent to a multicast destination address,
 and multicast being rather unreliable on busy Wi-Fi networks, the RA might not
 be received by local hosts.</li> 
	 <li>An automated device config management system performs periodic config
 pushes to network devices.  In these scenarios, network devices may simply immediately
 forget their previous configuration, rather than withdraw it gracefully.  If such a push results in
       changing the prefix configured on a particular subnet, hosts
       attached to that subnet might not get notified about the prefix
       change, and their addresses from the "old" prefix might not be
       deprecated.  A related scenario is an incorrect network renumbering event, where a network administrator renumbers a network by simply
       removing the "old" prefix from the configuration and configuring a
       new prefix instead.
 </li>
 
 <!-- [fgont] In the text above, is the use of "withdrowing" gramatically correct, or should we have said "withdraw" instead?
 -->
 
       </ul>
       <t>
 Lacking any explicit and reliable signaling to deprecate the
previously advertised prefixes, hosts may continue to employ the
previously configured addresses, which will typically result in packets being
blackholed (whether because of egress filtering by the CE router or ISP) or the
return traffic being discarded or routed elsewhere. </t> 
       <t>The default values for the Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime of
PIOs specified in <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/> mean that, in the
aforementioned scenarios, the stale addresses would be retained and could be
actively employed for new communication instances for an unacceptably long
period of time (one month and one week, respectively). This could lead to
interoperability problems, instead of hosts transitioning to the
newly advertised prefix(es) in a more timely manner.</t> 
       <t>Some devices have implemented ad hoc mechanisms to address this
problem, such as sending RAs to deprecate apparently stale prefixes when the
device receives any packets employing a source address from a prefix not
currently advertised for address configuration on the local network <xref
target="FRITZ" format="default"/>. However, this may introduce other
interoperability problems, particularly in multihomed/multi-prefix
scenarios. This is a clear indication that advice in this area is
warranted.</t> 
       <t>Unresponsiveness to these "flash-renumbering" events is caused by the
inability of the network to deprecate stale information as well as by the
inability of hosts to react to network configuration changes in a more timely
manner. Clearly, it would be desirable that these flash-renumbering events
do not occur and that, when they did occur, hosts were explicitly and
reliably notified of their occurrence. However, for robustness reasons, it is
paramount for hosts to be able to recover from stale configuration information
even when these flash-renumbering events occur and the network is unable to
explicitly and reliably notify hosts about such conditions. </t> 
       <t><xref target="problem" format="default"/> analyzes this problem in
more detail. <xref target="Solutions" format="default"/> describes possible
operational mitigations. <xref target="futurework" format="default"/> describes
possible future work to mitigate the aforementioned problem.</t>

       <name>Analysis of the Problem</name>
       <t>As noted in <xref target="intro" format="default"/>, the problem discussed in this document is exacerbated by the default values of some protocol parameters and other factors. The following sections analyze each of them in detail.</t>
       <section anchor="ops" numbered="true" toc="default">
	 <name>Use of Dynamic Prefixes</name>
	 <t>In network scenarios where dynamic prefixes are employed, renumbering events lead to updated network configuration information being propagated through the network, such that the renumbering events are gracefully handled. However, if the renumbering event happens along with, e.g., loss of configuration state by some of the devices involved in the renumbering procedure (e.g., a router crashes, reboots, and gets leased a new prefix), this may result in a flash-renumbering event, where new prefixes are introduced without properly phasing out the old ones.</t>
	 <t>In simple residential or small office scenarios, the problem discussed in this document would be avoided if DHCPv6-PD leased "stable" prefixes. However, a recent survey <xref target="UK-NOF" format="default"/> indicates that 37% of the responding ISPs employ dynamic IPv6 prefixes. That is, dynamic IPv6 prefixes are an operational reality.</t>
	 <t>Deployment reality aside, there are a number of possible issues associated with stable prefixes:
	 </t>
	 <ul spacing="normal">
	   <li>Provisioning systems may be unable to deliver stable IPv6 prefixes.</li>
	   <li>While an ISP might lease stable prefixes to the home or small
office, the Customer Edge router might in turn lease sub-prefixes of these
prefixes to other internal network devices. Unless the associated lease
databases were stored on non-volatile memory, these internal devices might get
leased dynamic sub-prefixes of the stable prefix leased by the ISP. In other
words, every time a prefix is leased, there is the potential for the resulting
prefixes to become dynamic, even if the device leasing sub-prefixes has been
leased a stable prefix by its upstream router. </li> 
	   <li>While there is a range of information that may be employed to
correlate network activity <xref target="RFC7721" format="default"/>, the use
of stable prefixes clearly simplifies network activity correlation and may
essentially render features, such as "temporary addresses" <xref
target="RFC4941" format="default"/>, irrelevant. </li> 
<!--[rfced] FYI, we have used the <strong> element around words marked with
*asterisks*. Please note that this generates asterisks in the text output and
bold in the HTML and PDF outputs. 
-->

<!-- [fgont] Ack! Thanks for the note! -->


	   <li>There might be existing advice for ISPs to deliver dynamic IPv6
prefixes <strong>by default</strong> (e.g., see <xref target="GERMAN-DP"
format="default"/>) over privacy concerns associated with stable prefixes.</li> 
	 </ul>
	 <t>For a number of reasons (such as the ones stated above), IPv6 deployments might employ dynamic prefixes (even at the expense of the issues discussed in this document), and there might be scenarios in which the dynamics of a network are such that the network exhibits the behavior of dynamic prefixes. Rather than trying to regulate how operators may run their networks, this document aims at improving network robustness in the deployed Internet.</t>

       <section anchor="timer-problem" numbered="true" toc="default">
	 <name>Default Lifetime Values in IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)</name>

 <t>The impact of the issue discussed in this document is a function of the lifetime values employed for PIOs, since these values determine for how long the corresponding addresses will be preferred and considered valid. Thus, when the problem discussed in this document is experienced, the longer the PIO lifetimes, the higher the impact.</t>
	 <t><xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/> specifies the following default PIO lifetime values:
 </t>
	 <ul spacing="normal">
	   <li>Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime): 604800 seconds (7 days)</li>
	   <li>Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime): 2592000 seconds (30 days)</li>
	 </ul>
	 <t>Under problematic circumstances, such as when the corresponding network information has become stale without any explicit and reliable signal from the network (as described in <xref target="intro" format="default"/>), it could take hosts up to 7 days
    (one week) to deprecate the corresponding addresses, and up to 30 days (one
    month) to eventually invalidate and remove any addresses configured
    for the stale prefix.  This means that it will typically take hosts
    an unacceptably long period of time (on the order of several days) to
    recover from these scenarios. </t>


 </section>
       <section anchor="hosts-problem" numbered="true" toc="default">
	 <name>Recovering from Stale Network Configuration Information</name>
	 <t>SLAAC hosts are unable to recover from stale network configuration information, since:
 </t>
	 <ul spacing="normal">
	   <li>Item "e)" of <xref target="RFC4862" sectionFormat="of"
 section="5.5.3"/> specifies that an unauthenticated RA may never reduce the
 RemainingLifetime to less than two hours. If the RemainingLifetime of an
 address is smaller than 2 hours, then a Valid Lifetime smaller than 2 hours
 will be ignored. The Preferred Lifetime of an address <strong>may</strong> be reduced to any
 value to avoid using a stale prefix for new communications. </li> 
	   <li>In the absence of explicit signaling from SLAAC routers (such as
 sending PIOs with the Preferred Lifetime set to 0), SLAAC hosts fail to recover
 from stale configuration information in a timely manner. However, when a
 network device is able to explicitly signal the renumbering event, it will
 be able to deprecate the stale prefix, but not to invalidate the prefix in
 question. Therefore, communication with the new "users" of the stale prefix
 will not be possible, since the stale prefix will still be considered
 "on-link".</li> 
	 </ul>

 </section>
       <section anchor="cpe-problem" numbered="true" toc="default">
	 <name>Lack of Explicit Signaling about Stale Information</name>
	 <t>Whenever prefix information has changed, a SLAAC router should advertise not only the new information, but also the
 stale information with appropriate lifetime values (both the Preferred
 Lifetime and the Valid Lifetime set to 0). This would provide explicit
 signaling to SLAAC hosts to remove the stale information (including
 configured addresses and routes). However, in certain scenarios, such as when a CE router crashes and reboots, the CE
router may have no knowledge about the previously advertised prefixes, and thus
might be unable to advertise them with appropriate lifetimes (in order to
deprecate them). </t> 
	 <t>In any case, we note that, as discussed in <xref target="hosts-problem"
format="default"/>, PIOs with small Valid Lifetimes in unauthenticated RAs will
not lower the Valid Lifetime to any value shorter than two hours (as per <xref
target="RFC4862" format="default"/>). Therefore, even if a SLAAC router tried
to explicitly signal the network about the stale configuration information via
unauthenticated RAs, implementations compliant with <xref target="RFC4862"
format="default"/> would deprecate the corresponding prefixes but would fail
to invalidate them. </t>
	   <aside>
<t>NOTE: Some implementations have been updated to honor small PIO lifetimes
values, as proposed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-slaac-renum"
format="default"/>. For example, please see <xref target="Linux-update"
format="default"/>.</t>

	 <name>Interaction between DHCPv6-PD and SLAAC</name>
	 <t>While DHCPv6-PD is normally employed along with SLAAC, the interaction between the two protocols is largely unspecified. Not unusually, the two protocols are implemented in two different software components, with the interface between the two implemented by means of some sort of script that feeds the SLAAC implementation with values learned from DHCPv6-PD.</t>
	 <t>At times, the prefix lease time is fed as a constant value to the
SLAAC router implementation, meaning that, eventually, the prefix lifetimes
advertised on the LAN side will span <strong>past</strong> the DHCPv6-PD lease
time. This is clearly incorrect, since the SLAAC router implementation would be
allowing the use of such prefixes for a period of time that is longer than the one they have been leased for via DHCPv6-PD. </t>

       <section numbered="true" toc="default">
	 <name>Stable Prefixes</name>
	 <t>As noted in <xref target="ops" format="default"/>, the use of
stable prefixes would eliminate the issue in <strong>some</strong> of the
scenarios discussed in <xref target="intro" format="default"/> of this
document, such as the typical home network deployment. However, even in such
scenarios, there might be reasons for which an administrator may want or may
need to employ dynamic prefixes.</t> 
       </section>
       <section anchor="host-side" numbered="true" toc="default">
	 <name>SLAAC Parameter Tweaking</name>
	 <t>An operator may wish to override some SLAAC parameters such that,
under normal circumstances, the associated timers will be refreshed/reset, but in the
presence of network faults (such as the one discussed in this document), the
associated timers go off and trigger some fault recovering action (e.g., deprecate and
subsequently invalidate stale addresses).</t> 
	 <t>The following router configuration variables from <xref
target="RFC4861" format="default"/> (corresponding to the "lifetime" parameters
of PIOs) could be overridden as follows:</t> 
	 <ul spacing="normal">
	   <li>AdvPreferredLifetime: 2700 seconds (45 minutes)</li>
	   <li>AdvValidLifetime: 5400 seconds (90 minutes)</li>
	 </ul>
	 
 <aside>
<t>NOTES:</t>

<t>The aforementioned values for AdvPreferredLifetime and AdvValidLifetime are
expected to be appropriate for most networks. In some networks, particularly
those where the operator has complete control of prefix allocation and where hosts on
the network may spend long periods of time sleeping (e.g., sensors with limited
battery), longer values may be appropriate.</t>  
	   <t>
 A CE router advertising a sub-prefix of a prefix leased via DHCPv6-PD, will
periodically refresh the Preferred Lifetime and the Valid Lifetime of an
advertised prefix to AdvPreferredLifetime and AdvValidLifetime, respectively,
as long as the resulting lifetimes of the corresponding prefixes do not extend
past the DHCPv6-PD lease time <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-slaac-renum"
format="default"/>. </t>

 </aside>
	   <t>RATIONALE:</t>
	     <ul spacing="normal">
	       <li>In the context of <xref target="RFC8028" format="default"/>,
where it is clear that use of addresses configured for a given prefix is tied
to using the next-hop router that advertised the prefix, it does not make sense
for the Preferred Lifetime of a PIO to be larger than the Router Lifetime
(AdvDefaultLifetime) of the corresponding Router Advertisement messages. The
Valid Lifetime is set to a larger value to cope with transient network
problems.</li> 


 <li>Lacking RAs that refresh information, addresses configured for advertised
prefixes become deprecated in a more timely manner; therefore, Rule 3 of <xref
target="RFC6724" format="default"/> causes other configured addresses (if
available) to be used instead.</li> 
	       <li>Reducing the Valid Lifetime of PIOs helps reduce the amount of time a host may maintain stale information,
 and the amount of time an advertising router would need to advertise stale
 prefixes to deprecate them. Reducing the Preferred Lifetime of PIOs helps reduce the amount of time it takes for a host to prefer other working
 prefixes (see <xref target="RFC4861" sectionFormat="of"
 section="12"/>). However, we note that while the values suggested in this section are an
 improvement over the default values specified in <xref target="RFC4861"
 format="default"/>, they represent a trade-off among a number of factors,
 including responsiveness, possible impact on the battery life of connected
 devices <xref target="RFC7772" format="default"/>, etc. Thus, they may or may
 not provide sufficient mitigation to the problem discussed in this
 document.</li>

       <t>Improvements in Customer Edge routers <xref target="RFC7084"

<!--[rfced] For the [UK-NOF] reference, the title does not seem
accurate for the content available from the URL provided. The URL 
goes to a presentation titled "Best Current Operational Practice for
operators:IPv6 Prefix Assignment for end-customers - persistent vs
non-persistent and what size to choose" (which matches the title of
[RIPE-690]), seemingly followed by the referenced content. So, if the
reader goes to slide 30, then they would find the referenced 
content.

We note that the URL
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/96/materials/slides-96-v6ops-3
goes to slides with the title below. How would you like to update 
the following reference?

Original:
   [UK-NOF]   Palet, J., "IPv6 Deployment Survey (Residential/Household
              Services) How IPv6 is being deployed?", UK NOF 39, January
              2018,
              <https://indico.uknof.org.uk/event/41/contributions/542/
              attachments/712/866/bcop-ipv6-prefix-v9.pdf>.

 <!--
[fgont]  Essentially, the speaker did two presentations in the same slot.
The two presentations were jointly announces as "IPv6 Deployment Survey and BCOP", but in practice they
were two different presentations by the same speaker, back to back.

The v6ops deck that you reference present the data in a different way, so I'd rather keep the current reference.
As a workaround, I have replaced the presentation title with the one announced on the web site, and the URL of the slides with the URL of the web site where both the video of the presentation and the slides are linked.
