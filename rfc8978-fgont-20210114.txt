 Reaction of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) to Flash-
                           Renumbering Events

Abstract

   In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
   prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit and reliable signaling
   of that condition (such as when a Customer Edge router crashes and
   reboots without knowledge of the previously employed prefixes), hosts
   on the local network may continue using stale prefixes for an
   unacceptably long time (on the order of several days), thus resulting
   in connectivity problems.  This document describes this issue and
   discusses operational workarounds that may help to improve network
   robustness.  Additionally, it highlights areas where further work may
   be needed.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] conveys
   information about prefixes to be employed for address configuration
   via Prefix Information Options (PIOs) sent in Router Advertisement
   (RA) messages.  IPv6 largely assumes prefix stability, with network
   renumbering only taking place in a planned manner, old/stale prefixes
   being phased out via reduced prefix lifetimes, and new prefixes (with
   longer lifetimes) being introduced at the same time.  However, there
   are several scenarios that may lead to the so-called "flash-
   renumbering" events, where a prefix employed by a network suddenly
   becomes invalid and replaced by a new prefix.  In some of these
   scenarios, the local router producing the network renumbering event
   may try to deprecate the currently employed prefix (by explicitly
   signaling the network about the renumbering event), whereas in other
   scenarios, it may be unable to do so.

   In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
   prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit and reliable signaling
   of that condition, hosts on the local network may continue using
   stale prefixes for an unacceptably long period of time, thus
   resulting in connectivity problems.

   Scenarios where this problem may arise include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

   *  The most common IPv6 deployment scenario for residential or small
      office networks, where a Customer Edge (CE) router employs DHCPv6
      Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC8415] to request a prefix from
      an Internet Service Provider (ISP), and a sub-prefix of the leased
      prefix is advertised on the LAN side of the CE router via
      Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862].  In
      scenarios where the CE router crashes and reboots, the CE router
      may obtain (via DHCPv6-PD) a different prefix from the one
      previously leased, and therefore advertise (via SLAAC) a new sub-
      prefix on the LAN side.  Hosts will typically configure addresses
      for the new prefix but will also normally retain and may actively
      employ the addresses configured for the previously advertised
      prefix, since their associated Preferred Lifetime and Valid
      Lifetime allow them to do so.

   *  A router (e.g., Customer Edge router) advertises autoconfiguration
      prefixes (corresponding to prefixes learned via DHCPv6-PD) with
      constant PIO lifetimes that are not synchronized with the
      DHCPv6-PD lease time (even though Section 6.3 of [RFC8415]
      requires such synchronization).  While this behavior violates the
      aforementioned requirement from [RFC8415], it is not an unusual
      behavior, particularly for implementations in which, e.g.,
      DHCPv6-PD is implemented in a different software module than the
      SLAAC router component.

   *  A switch port a host is connected to is moved to another subnet
      (VLAN) as a result of manual switch-port reconfiguration or 802.1x
      reauthentication.  There has been evidence that some 802.1x
      supplicants do not reset network settings after successful 802.1x
      authentication.  So if a host fails 802.1x authentication for some
      reason, is placed in a "quarantine" VLAN, and is successfully
      authenticated later on, it might end up having IPv6 addresses from
      both the old ("quarantine") and the new VLANs.

   *  During a planned network renumbering event, a router is configured
      to send an RA including a Prefix Information Option (PIO) for the
      "old" prefix with Preferred Lifetime set to zero and the Valid
      Lifetime set to a small value, and a PIO for the new prefix with
      default lifetimes.  However, due to unsolicited RAs being sent to
      a multicast destination address, and multicast being rather
      unreliable on busy Wi-Fi networks, the RA might not be received by
      local hosts.

   *  An automated device config management system performs periodic
      config pushes to network devices.  In these scenarios, network
      devices may simply immediately forget their previous
      configuration, rather than withdraw it gracefully.  If such a push
      results in changing the prefix configured on a particular subnet,
      hosts attached to that subnet might not get notified about the
      prefix change, and their addresses from the "old" prefix might not
      be deprecated.  A related scenario is an incorrect network
      renumbering event, where a network administrator renumbers a
      network by simply removing the "old" prefix from the configuration
      and configuring a new prefix instead.

   Lacking any explicit and reliable signaling to deprecate the
   previously advertised prefixes, hosts may continue to employ the
   previously configured addresses, which will typically result in
   packets being blackholed (whether because of egress filtering by the
   CE router or ISP) or the return traffic being discarded or routed
   elsewhere.

   The default values for the Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime of
   PIOs specified in [RFC4861] mean that, in the aforementioned
   scenarios, the stale addresses would be retained and could be
   actively employed for new communication instances for an unacceptably
   long period of time (one month and one week, respectively).  This
   could lead to interoperability problems, instead of hosts
   transitioning to the newly advertised prefix(es) in a more timely
   manner.

   Some devices have implemented ad hoc mechanisms to address this
   problem, such as sending RAs to deprecate apparently stale prefixes
   when the device receives any packets employing a source address from
   a prefix not currently advertised for address configuration on the
   local network [FRITZ].  However, this may introduce other
   interoperability problems, particularly in multihomed/multi-prefix
   scenarios.  This is a clear indication that advice in this area is
   warranted.

   Unresponsiveness to these "flash-renumbering" events is caused by the
   inability of the network to deprecate stale information as well as by
   the inability of hosts to react to network configuration changes in a
   more timely manner.  Clearly, it would be desirable that these flash-
   renumbering events do not occur and that, when they did occur, hosts
   were explicitly and reliably notified of their occurrence.  However,
   for robustness reasons, it is paramount for hosts to be able to
   recover from stale configuration information even when these flash-
   renumbering events occur and the network is unable to explicitly and
   reliably notify hosts about such conditions.

   Section 2 analyzes this problem in more detail.  Section 3 describes
   possible operational mitigations.  Section 4 describes possible
   future work to mitigate the aforementioned problem.

2.  Analysis of the Problem

   As noted in Section 1, the problem discussed in this document is
   exacerbated by the default values of some protocol parameters and
   other factors.  The following sections analyze each of them in
   detail.

2.1.  Use of Dynamic Prefixes

   In network scenarios where dynamic prefixes are employed, renumbering
   events lead to updated network configuration information being
   propagated through the network, such that the renumbering events are
   gracefully handled.  However, if the renumbering event happens along
   with, e.g., loss of configuration state by some of the devices
   involved in the renumbering procedure (e.g., a router crashes,
   reboots, and gets leased a new prefix), this may result in a flash-
   renumbering event, where new prefixes are introduced without properly
   phasing out the old ones.

   In simple residential or small office scenarios, the problem
   discussed in this document would be avoided if DHCPv6-PD leased
   "stable" prefixes.  However, a recent survey [UK-NOF] indicates that
   37% of the responding ISPs employ dynamic IPv6 prefixes.  That is,
   dynamic IPv6 prefixes are an operational reality.

   Deployment reality aside, there are a number of possible issues
   associated with stable prefixes:

   *  Provisioning systems may be unable to deliver stable IPv6
      prefixes.

   *  While an ISP might lease stable prefixes to the home or small
      office, the Customer Edge router might in turn lease sub-prefixes
      of these prefixes to other internal network devices.  Unless the
      associated lease databases were stored on non-volatile memory,
      these internal devices might get leased dynamic sub-prefixes of
      the stable prefix leased by the ISP.  In other words, every time a
      prefix is leased, there is the potential for the resulting
      prefixes to become dynamic, even if the device leasing sub-
      prefixes has been leased a stable prefix by its upstream router.

   *  While there is a range of information that may be employed to
      correlate network activity [RFC7721], the use of stable prefixes
      clearly simplifies network activity correlation and may
      essentially render features, such as "temporary addresses"
      [RFC4941], irrelevant.

   *  There might be existing advice for ISPs to deliver dynamic IPv6
      prefixes *by default* (e.g., see [GERMAN-DP]) over privacy
      concerns associated with stable prefixes.

   For a number of reasons (such as the ones stated above), IPv6
   deployments might employ dynamic prefixes (even at the expense of the
   issues discussed in this document), and there might be scenarios in
   which the dynamics of a network are such that the network exhibits
   the behavior of dynamic prefixes.  Rather than trying to regulate how
   operators may run their networks, this document aims at improving
   network robustness in the deployed Internet.

2.2.  Default Lifetime Values in IPv6 Stateless Address
      Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)

   The impact of the issue discussed in this document is a function of
   the lifetime values employed for PIOs, since these values determine
   for how long the corresponding addresses will be preferred and
   considered valid.  Thus, when the problem discussed in this document
   is experienced, the longer the PIO lifetimes, the higher the impact.

   [RFC4861] specifies the following default PIO lifetime values:

   *  Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime): 604800 seconds (7 days)

   *  Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime): 2592000 seconds (30 days)

   Under problematic circumstances, such as when the corresponding
   network information has become stale without any explicit and
   reliable signal from the network (as described in Section 1), it
   could take hosts up to 7 days (one week) to deprecate the
   corresponding addresses, and up to 30 days (one month) to eventually
   invalidate and remove any addresses configured for the stale prefix.
   This means that it will typically take hosts an unacceptably long
   period of time (on the order of several days) to recover from these
   scenarios.

2.3.  Recovering from Stale Network Configuration Information

   SLAAC hosts are unable to recover from stale network configuration
   information, since:

   *  Item "e)" of Section 5.5.3 of [RFC4862] specifies that an
      unauthenticated RA may never reduce the RemainingLifetime to less
      than two hours.  If the RemainingLifetime of an address is smaller
      than 2 hours, then a Valid Lifetime smaller than 2 hours will be
      ignored.  The Preferred Lifetime of an address *may* be reduced to
      any value to avoid using a stale prefix for new communications.

   *  In the absence of explicit signaling from SLAAC routers (such as
      sending PIOs with the Preferred Lifetime set to 0), SLAAC hosts
      fail to recover from stale configuration information in a timely
      manner.  However, when a network device is able to explicitly
      signal the renumbering event, it will be able to deprecate the
      stale prefix, but not to invalidate the prefix in question.
      Therefore, communication with the new "users" of the stale prefix
      will not be possible, since the stale prefix will still be
      considered "on-link".

2.4.  Lack of Explicit Signaling about Stale Information

   Whenever prefix information has changed, a SLAAC router should
   advertise not only the new information, but also the stale
   information with appropriate lifetime values (both the Preferred
   Lifetime and the Valid Lifetime set to 0).  This would provide
   explicit signaling to SLAAC hosts to remove the stale information
   (including configured addresses and routes).  However, in certain
   scenarios, such as when a CE router crashes and reboots, the CE
   router may have no knowledge about the previously advertised
   prefixes, and thus might be unable to advertise them with appropriate
   lifetimes (in order to deprecate them).

   In any case, we note that, as discussed in Section 2.3, PIOs with
   small Valid Lifetimes in unauthenticated RAs will not lower the Valid
   Lifetime to any value shorter than two hours (as per [RFC4862]).
   Therefore, even if a SLAAC router tried to explicitly signal the
   network about the stale configuration information via unauthenticated
   RAs, implementations compliant with [RFC4862] would deprecate the
   corresponding prefixes but would fail to invalidate them.

      |  NOTE: Some implementations have been updated to honor small PIO
      |  lifetimes values, as proposed in [RENUM-RXN].  For example,
      |  please see [Linux-update].

2.5.  Interaction between DHCPv6-PD and SLAAC

   While DHCPv6-PD is normally employed along with SLAAC, the
   interaction between the two protocols is largely unspecified.  Not
   unusually, the two protocols are implemented in two different
   software components, with the interface between the two implemented
   by means of some sort of script that feeds the SLAAC implementation
   with values learned from DHCPv6-PD.

   At times, the prefix lease time is fed as a constant value to the
   SLAAC router implementation, meaning that, eventually, the prefix
   lifetimes advertised on the LAN side will span *past* the DHCPv6-PD
   lease time.  This is clearly incorrect, since the SLAAC router
   implementation would be allowing the use of such prefixes for a
   period of time that is longer than the one they have been leased for
   via DHCPv6-PD.

3.  Operational Mitigations

   The following subsections discuss possible operational workarounds
   for the aforementioned problems.

3.1.  Stable Prefixes

   As noted in Section 2.1, the use of stable prefixes would eliminate
   the issue in *some* of the scenarios discussed in Section 1 of this
   document, such as the typical home network deployment.  However, even
   in such scenarios, there might be reasons for which an administrator
   may want or may need to employ dynamic prefixes.

3.2.  SLAAC Parameter Tweaking

   An operator may wish to override some SLAAC parameters such that,
   under normal circumstances, the associated timers will be refreshed/
   reset, but in the presence of network faults (such as the one
   discussed in this document), the associated timers go off and trigger
   some fault recovering action (e.g., deprecate and subsequently
   invalidate stale addresses).

   The following router configuration variables from [RFC4861]
   (corresponding to the "lifetime" parameters of PIOs) could be
   overridden as follows:

   *  AdvPreferredLifetime: 2700 seconds (45 minutes)

   *  AdvValidLifetime: 5400 seconds (90 minutes)

      |  NOTES:
      |  
      |  The aforementioned values for AdvPreferredLifetime and
      |  AdvValidLifetime are expected to be appropriate for most
      |  networks.  In some networks, particularly those where the
      |  operator has complete control of prefix allocation and where
      |  hosts on the network may spend long periods of time sleeping
      |  (e.g., sensors with limited battery), longer values may be
      |  appropriate.
      |  
      |  A CE router advertising a sub-prefix of a prefix leased via
      |  DHCPv6-PD, will periodically refresh the Preferred Lifetime and
      |  the Valid Lifetime of an advertised prefix to
      |  AdvPreferredLifetime and AdvValidLifetime, respectively, as
      |  long as the resulting lifetimes of the corresponding prefixes
      |  do not extend past the DHCPv6-PD lease time [RENUM-CPE].

   RATIONALE:

   *  In the context of [RFC8028], where it is clear that use of
      addresses configured for a given prefix is tied to using the next-
      hop router that advertised the prefix, it does not make sense for
      the Preferred Lifetime of a PIO to be larger than the Router
      Lifetime (AdvDefaultLifetime) of the corresponding Router
      Advertisement messages.  The Valid Lifetime is set to a larger
      value to cope with transient network problems.

   *  Lacking RAs that refresh information, addresses configured for
      advertised prefixes become deprecated in a more timely manner;
      therefore, Rule 3 of [RFC6724] causes other configured addresses
      (if available) to be used instead.

   *  Reducing the Valid Lifetime of PIOs helps reduce the amount of
      time a host may maintain stale information, and the amount of time
      an advertising router would need to advertise stale prefixes to
      deprecate them.  Reducing the Preferred Lifetime of PIOs helps
      reduce the amount of time it takes for a host to prefer other
      working prefixes (see Section 12 of [RFC4861]).  However, we note
      that while the values suggested in this section are an improvement
      over the default values specified in [RFC4861], they represent a
      trade-off among a number of factors, including responsiveness,
      possible impact on the battery life of connected devices
      [RFC7772], etc.  Thus, they may or may not provide sufficient
      mitigation to the problem discussed in this document.

4.  Future Work

   Improvements in Customer Edge routers [RFC7084], such that they can
   signal hosts about stale prefixes and deprecate them accordingly, can
   help mitigate the problem discussed in this document for the "home
   network" scenario.  Such work is currently being pursued in
   [RENUM-CPE].

   Improvements in the SLAAC protocol [RFC4862] and some IPv6-related
   algorithms, such as "Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol
   Version 6 (IPv6)" [RFC6724], would help improve network robustness.
   Such work is currently being pursued in [RENUM-RXN].

   The aforementioned work is considered out of the scope of this
   present document, which only focuses on documenting the problem and
   discussing operational mitigations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses a problem that may arise in scenarios where
   flash-renumbering events occur, and proposes workarounds to mitigate
   the aforementioned problem.  This document does not introduce any new
   security issues; therefore, the same security considerations as for
   [RFC4861] and [RFC4862] apply.
