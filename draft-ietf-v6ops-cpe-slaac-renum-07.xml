This document specifies improvements to Customer Edge Routers that help mitigate the problems that may arise when network configuration information becomes invalid, without any explicit signaling of that condition to the affected nodes. This document updates RFC7084.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>In scenarios where network configuration information becomes invalid without any explicit signaling of that condition (such as when a Customer Edge Router crashes and reboots without knowledge of the previously-employed configuration information), hosts on the local network will continue using stale information for an unacceptably long period of time, thus resulting in connectivity problems. This problem is documented in detail in <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-slaac-renum"/>.</t>

<t>This document specifies improvements to Customer Edge (CE) Routers that help mitigate the aforementioned problem for residential and small office scenarios. It specifies recommendations for the default behavior of CE Routers, and does not preclude the availability of configuration knobs that might allow an operator or user to manually-configure the CE Router to deviate from these recommendations. This document updates RFC7084.

   <section anchor="CPE" title="Improved Customer Edge Router Behavior">
<t>This section specifies and clarifies requirements for Customer Edge Routers that can help mitigate the problem discussed in <xref target="intro"/>, particularly when they employ prefixes learned via DHCPv6-Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) <xref target="RFC8415"/> on the WAN-side with Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862"/> or DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"/> on the LAN-side. The recommendations in this document help improve robustness at the Customer Edge Router (on which the user or ISP may have no control), and do not preclude implementation of host-side improvements such as those specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-slaac-renum"/>.</t>


<t>This document specifies additional prefix-delegation requirements to those specified in <xref target="RFC7084"/>:

	<list style="symbols">
	
		<t>WPD-9: CE routers SHOULD NOT automatically send DHCPv6-PD RELEASE messages upon reboot events. See <xref target="dhcpv6-release"/> for further details.</t>
		
		<t>WPD-10: CE Routers MUST by default use a stable IAID value that does not change between CE Router restarts, DHCPv6 client restarts, or interface state changes. e.g., Transient PPP interfaces. See <xref target="dhcpv6-iaid"/> for further details.</t>
	</list>
	
</t>



<t>This document also replaces LAN-side requirement L-13 from <xref target="RFC7084"/> with:

<list style="symbols">
		<t>L-13: CE routers MUST signal stale configuration information as specified in <xref target="sig-stale-config"/>.</t>
</list>

<t>Finally, this document specifies the following additional LAN-side requirements to those from <xref target="RFC7084"/>:

	<list style="symbols">
		<t>L-15: CE routers MUST NOT advertise prefixes via SLAAC or assign addresses or delegate prefixes via DHCPv6 on the LAN-side, employing lifetimes that exceed the remaining lifetimes of the corresponding prefixes learned from the WAN-side via DHCPv6-PD.

    <section title="Automatic DHCPv6 RELEASEs" anchor="dhcpv6-release">
<t>
Some CE Routers are known to automatically send DHCPv6-PD RELEASE messages upon reboot events. However, this may inadvertently trigger a flash-renumbering scenario, along with the associated problems discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-slaac-renum"/>, that this document attempts to mitigate.
</t>

<t>
As a result, requirement WPD-9 from <xref target="CPE"/> specifies that CE routers SHOULD NOT automatically send DHCPv6-PD RELEASE messages upon reboot events. 
</t>
</section>


    <section title="Stability of IAIDs" anchor="dhcpv6-iaid">
<t>
   <xref target="RFC8415"/> requires that the IAID for an IA MUST be consistent across
   restarts of the DHCP client. However, some popular CE Routers are
   known to select new random IAIDs e.g. everytime the underlying PPP
   session is established. This could be the result of extrapolating the
   behavior described in <xref target="RFC7844"/>, or simply a consequence of not
   storing IAIDs on stable storage along with failing to employ an algorithm
   that consistently generates the same IAID upon reboots. Thus, requirement WPD-10 from <xref target="CPE"/> prevents CE Routers from inadvertently triggering flash-renumbering events on the local network.

<section title="Interface Between WAN-side and LAN-side" anchor="dhcpv6-pd-slaac">
<t>The "Preferred Lifetime" and "Valid Lifetime" of Prefix Information Options (PIOs) <xref target="RFC4861"/> corresponding to prefixes learned via DHCPv6-PD MUST NOT span past the remaining preferred and valid lifetimes of the corresponding DHCPv6-PD prefixes. This means that the "Preferred Lifetime" and the "Valid Lifetime" advertised in PIOs by the CE router MUST be dynamically adjusted such that they never span past the remaining preferred and valid lifetimes of the corresponding prefixes delegated via DHCPv6-PD on the WAN-side.</t>

<t>Similarly, the "preferred-lifetime" and "valid-lifetime" of DHCPv6 IA Address Options and DHCPv6 IA Prefix Options employed with DHCPv6 on the LAN-side MUST NOT span past the remaining preferred and valid lifetimes of the corresponding prefixes leased via DHCPv6-PD on the WAN-side.

</t>

<t>CE Routers SHOULD set the Router Lifetime to ND_PREFERRED_LIMIT.</t>

<t>CE Routers SHOULD also set the PIO Preferred Lifetime to the lesser of the remaining preferred lifetime (see <xref target="dhcpv6-pd-slaac"/>) and ND_PREFERRED_LIMIT, and the PIO Valid Lifetime to the lesser of the remaining valid lifetime and ND_VALID_LIMIT. Additionally, the Route Lifetime of Route Information Options (RIOs) <xref target="RFC4191"/>, the Lifetime of Recursive DNS Search Options (RDNSSO) <xref target="RFC8106"/>, and the Lifetime of DNS Search List Options (DNSSLO) <xref target="RFC8106"/> SHOULD be set to the lesser of the longest valid-lifetime in a DHCPv6 IA Prefix Option (received via DHCPv6 on the WAN-side) and ND_VALID_LIMIT, if any of these options are included in Router Advertisement messages.

Similarly, CE Routers need not employ the (possibly long) WAN-side DHCPv6-PD lifetimes for the valid-lifetime and preferred-lifetime of IA Address Options and IA Prefix Option employed by DHCPv6 on the LAN-side, since the renewal of bindings by DHCPv6 clients will lead to the same effective lifetimes as specified by the WAN-side DHCPv6-PD lifetimes.

<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="RATIONALE:">
	<list style="symbols">

		<t>IPv6 network renumbering is expected to take place in a planned manner, with old/stale prefixes being phased-out via reduced prefix lifetimes while new prefixes (with normal lifetimes) are introduced. However, a number of scenarios may lead to the so-called "flash-renumbering" events, where the prefix being employed on a network suddenly becomes invalid and replaced by a new prefix <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-slaac-renum"/>. One such scenario is when a DHCPv6 server employs dynamic prefixes
and the Customer Edge Router crashes and reboots. The requirements in this section are meant to allow Customer Edge Routers to deprecate stale information in such scenarios.
		</t>

		<t>The recommendations in this section expand from requirement L-13 in Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC7084"/>, and Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC8415"/>.</t>

		<t>Host configuring addresses via SLAAC on the local network may employ addresses configured for the previously advertised prefixes for at most the "Valid Lifetime" of the corresponding PIO of the last received Router Advertisement message. Since Router Advertisement messages may be lost or fail to be received for various reasons, Customer Edge Routers need to try to deprecate stale prefixes for a period of time equal to the "Valid Lifetime" of the PIO employed when originally advertising the prefix.</t>

		<t>The requirement in this section is conveyed as a "SHOULD" (as opposed to a "MUST"), since the requirement to store information on stable storage may represent a challenge for some implementations.</t>
<t>Advertising DHCPv6-leased prefixes with zero lifetimes on the LAN-side would handle the case where a CE Router has no stable storage but receives the prefixes via DHCPv6 with 0 lifetimes.</t>

   
   <t>The above text does not include DHCPv6 Advertise messages sent in
   response to DHCPv6 Solicit messages, since Section 18.3.9 of
   <xref target="RFC8415"/> requires that a DHCPv6 server
   that is not going to assign an address or delegated prefix received
   as a hint in the Solicit message MUST NOT include that address or
   delegated prefix in the Advertise message. Additionally, any
   subsequent Request messages will trigger the response specified in
   this section, and therefore cause the address or prefix to be
   deprecated.</t>
